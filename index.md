            <br />Are there changes you would like to make in your life&#63;
            <br />Some people want to achieve excellence in their chosen field such as sports, music or acting. Others want to make changes in their personal lives or may wish for more inward change, to be happier, more peaceful or loving. If we look closely at ourselves and at our lives, there is usually something we would like to change.</p>
            <p>I discovered the Alexander Technique when I was working in the Theatre as an actress and writer, suffering from chronic back pain and looking for how I could change that. It helped me develop a strong back and much more&#33; I was so enthusiastic about the principles and practice that I decided to become an Alexander Technique teacher.</p>
            <p>At the same time I studied the esoteric teachings of the Chakras in England and America, and from this I learnt a lot more about the relationship of mind and body.</p>
            <p>My successful first book <a href="{% link books.md %}#theartofchanging" target="_self">The Art of Changing</a> is a thorough introduction to the principles of the Alexander Technique, including an exploration of the emotional and energetic aspects of the mind and body.</p>
            <p>My recently published book <a href="{% link books.md %}#touchingthesoul" target="_self">Chakra Healing Therapy</a> is an in-depth exploration of the chakras, linking the physical, psychological, psychic and spiritual levels of our being.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Life is a continual process of change&hellip; Learning how to change and how to respond to change in a creative way is one of lifeâ€™s most valuable skills</blockquote>
            <p>I offer <a href="{% link work.md %}#sessions" target="_self">Individual sessions</a> and <a href="{% link work.md %}#sessions" target="_self">Workshops</a> in both the Alexander Technique and Chakra Healing Therapy. I also offer training in Chakra Healing Therapy for Alexander Teachers and complementary health therapists.</p>
            <p>I have been teaching for over 25 years, including work in the UK, Europe, United States, Australia and Japan and I am a teaching member of <a href="http://www.ati-net.com" target="_blank">Alexander Technique International</a>, where I was delighted to give a keynote address at their conference in 2003.</p>
            <p>If there are changes that you would like to make, from dealing with a painful physical problem to looking at more psychological and spiritual issues, I warmly invite you to explore the site and &frasl; or <a href="{% link contact.md %}" target="_self">contact me</a> to find out more.</p>

            <p class="pwhite">FM Alexander discovered principles about the body, which we share with all vertebrate animals. Working consciously with these principles enabled him to regain a quality of balance and poise in his body and to make deep and lasting changes in the way he used his voice, which as an actor was vitally important to him.</p>
